# 
# >> **Statistics:**
# 
# - The median is higher than the mean, which suggests that while there are more negative differences, the magnitude of underperformance is not as significant in most cases.
# 
# - The standard deviation is relatively high, which indicates high risk. This could affect the hedging strategy for a company.
# 
# - The minimum value shows a possibility of significant negative hedging revenue, using Asian puts, which in the worst case scenarios could lead to high hedging costs.
# 
# - The 5th percentile shows significant negative outcomes, which management should consider as a possible risk. and the the 95th percentile indicates that the best outcomes of the Asian put strategy are considerable.
# 
# **Advantages of Asian Put Hedging Strategy:**
# 
# 1. Asian put lowers the risk. More values are concentrated around 0 so this means that while there are times where the Asian put underperforms compared to the European put(Asian < European), the strategy generally avoids extreme losses.
# 
# 2. Asian puts are more cost effiecient. We have to pay the premium on 1 Asian put contract which is cheaper than 12 put options. They also have lower transaction costs.
# 
# 3. Less complex to manage than 12 puts contracts.
# 
# **Disadvantages of Asian Put Hedging Strategy:**
# 
# 1. The mean of the differences is 1, indicating that on average, there is no significant advantage to using Asian puts over European puts. Moreover, it can be seen that there are many negative outcomes, suggesting that in many scenarios, Asian puts may do poorly.
# 
# 2. The proportion of negative differences is around 31.4% and from that we can get,in a significant amount of situations, the hedging strategy with Asian put have lower hedging revenues copmpared to European one.
# 
# **Strategic Advice:**
# 
# Given the results, our hedging strategy should be adjusted to the company's behavior towards risk and market outlook. If the company is risk seeker and can accept the possibility of slight underperformance, then Asian puts could be included as part of a diversified hedging strategy. However, if the company is risk-averse or if we anticipate a highly volatile market, the approach towards Asian puts should be done with caution. It could be wise to use a combination of Asian and European puts to balance the hedging portfolio because the data points to a mixed performance and also by combining the advantages of each option type, this mixed method may be able to lessen their drawbacks.

    revenue_with_hedge_asian = revenues_without_hedge + asian_put_profits
    differences_hedged_revenues = revenue_with_hedge_asian - revenue_with_hedge_european
    
    # Calculate statistics for the differences
    stats = {
        "Mean": np.mean(differences_hedged_revenues),
        "Median": np.median(differences_hedged_revenues),
        "Standard Deviation": np.std(differences_hedged_revenues),
        "Minimum": np.min(differences_hedged_revenues),

    }
    
    # Add the results to the dictionary
    results[f'case{case}'] = stats

# Convert the results dictionary to a DataFrame for display
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Display the table
print(results_df)


# - The average value in case 2 is negative which suggests that on average as the volatility increases, the Asian put underperforms leading to losses.
# 
# - The standard deviation in case 2 is almost double that of case 1 and significantly higher than in case 3(case 3 being almost half of case 1). This implies that higher volatility which means higher risk, leads to greater uncertainty in the hedging outcome.
# 
# - By comparing case 1 with case 2 it can be seen that the range of outcomes widens significantly as volatility increases. However, the maximum value remains the same across all cases, indicating that the highest outcomes of the hedging strategies does not increase with higher volatility.
# 
# In summary, the results suggest that as volatility increases, the risks associated with hedging using Asian options also increase. This is demonstrated by more frequent and more significant underperformances compared to European options. Conversely, when volatility is lower, Asian options tend to perform more favorably, with a lower risk of underperformance.
